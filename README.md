  token.

  CLIENTID with the value of your application Client ID (in "General Information).

## Aliases

You can set alias to roll expression:
```
/alias set fs 1d6ie6 - 1d6ie6
> Alias fs set

/r fs
> Geob roll: [4] - [5] Result: -1
```

To use aliases, you need to create a role in the server with Administrator permission.

The administrator can manipulate aliases, and can add/remove user to the list of people
allowed to manipulate aliases:

```
/alias allow @User<Tab>
/alias disallow @User<Tab>
```

It is important to use the `Tab` key to complete the user to get the mention.

Once in the list, the user can add/delete alias without having Administrator permission.
